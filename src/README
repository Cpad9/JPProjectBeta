This project creates a flexible structure that can be used in any production line.
The program allows easy modification to handle a wide variety of products
It creates interfaces to ensure all products have their required methods
such as setProductionNumber, setName, getName, getManufactureDate,getSerialNumber.
This program allows you to create a wide variety of products while still
being able to easily access and control information about them.

This template made in java is used to create and record all future production line items.
This is a flexible structure that can be easily edited to allow use in other products
besides the ones initially implemented.
